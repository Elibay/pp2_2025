## Python iterators and generators

1. Create a generator that generates the squares of numbers up to some number `N`.

2. Write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and `n` in comma separated form where `n` is input from console.

3. Define a function with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 3 and 4, between a given range 0 and `n`.

4. Implement a generator called `squares` to yield the square of all numbers from (a) to (b). Test it with a "for" loop and print each of the yielded values.

5. Implement a generator that returns all numbers from (n) down to 0.



## Python date

1. Write a Python program to subtract five days from current date.

2. Write a Python program to print yesterday, today, tomorrow.

3. Write a Python program to drop microseconds from datetime.

4. Write a Python program to calculate two date difference in seconds.


## Python Math library

1. Write a Python program to convert degree to radian.
```
Input degree: 15
Output radian: 0.261904
```

2. Write a Python program to calculate the area of a trapezoid.
```
Height: 5
Base, first value: 5
Base, second value: 6
Expected Output: 27.5
```

3. Write a Python program to calculate the area of regular polygon.
```
Input number of sides: 4
Input the length of a side: 25
The area of the polygon is: 625
```

4. Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram. 
```
Length of base: 5
Height of parallelogram: 6
Expected Output: 30.0
```
